# LaredocMind - Backend

## Description
LaredocMind backend exposes a REST API where users can send questions and receive answers generated by the chatbot. The backend is built using LangGraph, enabling advanced conversational flows and context management. It supports document ingestion (local and web), embeddings, and evaluation, but its main purpose is to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries through the chatbot interface.

## Installation and Quick Start

**Important:** Before starting the installation, create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your required API keys and environment variables using `.env.example`. Example:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
...
```

You can set up and run the backend using either the quick script option or by following the manual steps.

### Quick Option (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
2. Run the following script to install all dependencies and prepare the environment:
   ```sh
   setup_backend.bat
   ```
3. To start the backend server once instaled, run:
   ```sh
   run_backend.bat
   ```

### Manual Option

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have **Python 3.13 or higher** installed. Check by running `python --version` in your terminal.

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Poetry (if not already installed):**
   ```sh
   pip install poetry
   ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

5. **Run the backend server:**
   ```sh
   .\run_backend.bat
   ```

6. **Verify the backend is running:**
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:20000/hello](http://localhost:20000/hello). If everything is working, you will see a greeting message. Change 20000 to the port you selected. (20000 by default)

## Detailed Folder and File Descriptions

### `docs/`
Contains user guides, technical documentation, and reference material for Laredo.

---

### `src/`
Main source code, organized by responsibility:

#### `api/`
Implements the REST API endpoints and chatbot service:

#### `chatbot/`
Core chatbot logic and orchestration:
- `chat_initializer.py`: Initializes chatbot components.
- `core_initializer.py`: Sets up models, embeddings, and document management.
- `graph_initializer.py`: Manages the chatbot's state graph and conversational flow (using LangGraph).
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the chatbot in standalone mode (consoe).

#### `config/`
Configuration files for parameters, URLs, and settings:
- `config_chatbot.py`: Prompt templates and chatbot-specific settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **PYTHONPATH Issues**: If you encounter import errors, run `init.bat` to set the correct PYTHONPATH for Windows.
- **Dependency Problems**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `poetry install` and that your virtual environment is activated.
- **Database Errors**: Confirm that the `database/` folder is writable and that the Chroma database files are not corrupted. If the app behaves unexpectedly, try deleting the contents of the `database/` folder before restarting the backend.
- **API Not Responding**: Make sure the backend is running (`python src/wsgi.py`) and check for errors in the terminal.
- **Port Conflicts**: If the server fails to start, verify that the default port is not in use by another process.

### Verifying the Backend
- To verify the backend is running correctly, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/hello`. If everything is working, you should see a hello message.

### Debugging
- You can enable debug mode in the logger to display more detailed information about what is happening in the backend. Check the `logger_manager.py` file in `src/utils/` for configuration options, and set the logger to debug level if you need more verbose output.
