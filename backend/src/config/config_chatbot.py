# 2. Recent Messages Prompt (Improved)
RECENT_MESSAGES_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["messages"],
    template="""
Recent conversation history:
<messages>{messages}</messages>

Instructions for responding:
1. If the user asks for clarification, more details, or expresses confusion (e.g., "Can you explain more?", "I don't understand", "Please clarify"):
   - Use the recent conversation history to infer the context.
   - Refer specifically to the last relevant message if unsure.
   - Provide a clear and coherent response related to the identified topic.

2. If the user introduces a new topic:
   - Address the new topic independently without relying on the conversation history.

3. Maintain the flow, tone, and style consistent with the previous conversation.

7. Return only a valid JSON object with two fields:
   - 'language': Detected language code (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'ja', etc.).

Important rules:
- Translate exactly as written. Do not ask for clarification.
- Do not add any interpretation, examples, or questions.
